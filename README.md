# üè¶ Loan Eligibility Predictor

This project predicts whether a loan applicant should be **approved or rejected** using classification models trained on personal, financial, and credit-related features. It's built using **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**, and includes full preprocessing and evaluation.

## üìå Problem Statement

Financial institutions want to reduce loan default risks by assessing whether an applicant is eligible for a loan. This project uses machine learning models to make those predictions based on features such as:

- Home ownership
- Income
- Credit history
- Employment length
- Loan amount and purpose
